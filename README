ASFBot - Multipurpose secretarial bot
#####################################


========================
Installation and running
========================
1) Download the bot from https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/infrastructure/trunk/projects/svnbot/
2) Install Lua 5.1/5.2 (whichever you can get your hands on, but NOT 5.0)
3) Install LuaSec and LuaSocket
4) Set up default channels and options in asfbot.cfg (use your favorite text editor)
5) Copy the `asfbot` file to /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ or where applicable and edit it so that the paths match
6) run: nohup lua-5.1 asfbot.lua & (This should be done from ASFBot's folder, eg /usr/local/etc/svnbot)

=====
Karma
=====
Karma is used to access the features that are not meant for everyone.
Infrastructure people will usually have a karma level of 10, which grants access to all features.
To give a specific person karma on IRC, use the following command:
`ASFBot: karma add [nick] [level]`, for example: `ASFBot: karma add Humbedooh 3`.
This karma will be tied to the ident of the user, so please try to constrain this to registered users 
with a working cloak. To make the karma stick, add an entry in asfbot.cfg in the [Karma] section, as such:

  johndoe    apache/committer/johndoe 3
  
The following karma levels are in effect (more to be added):

[Action]                            [Required karma]
Restart/stop ASFBot                     10

Use the beer tab                         0

====================
Setting up reporting
====================
Reporting should initially be set up via the IRC interface, by asking ASFBot to join the appropriate channel.
The following commands are usually used via #asftest:

1) `ASFSvnBot: join #channel-name`
   (Join the channel yourself and execute step 2 in there)
2) `ASFSvnBot: subscribe projectname`

Once that is done, add an entry to the `channels` list in asfbot.cfg and commit the changes:

[channel:#channel-name]
  tags: project-subversion-name othertag thirdtag

You can use `ASFBot: reconfigure` to reload asfbot.cfg with your changes (don't forget to svn up first!)

For incubator projects, use the special tag `incubator.projectname` which will match against both 
`incubator/projectname` (Subversion) and `incubator-projectname` (Git repository).

==============
JIRA Reporting
==============
JIRA reporting works by emails sent to asfbot@urd.zones.apache.org being run through dumpsubject.lua, 
which - in the case of a JIRA update - passes this information onto the resident pubsub service on port
2069 (this is an inactive gitpubsub daemon that just passes on information)

To subscribe a channel to JIRA reporting, follow these steps:

1) Subscribe asfbot@urd.zones.apache.org to the mailing list that reports JIRA updates
2) In the appropriate channel, write: `ASFBot: subscribe JIRA:[jira-name]` (fx JIRA:INFRA) OR
3) Add the JIRA:[jira-name] tag to asfbot.cfg and run `ASFBot: reconfigure`.


========
Factoids
========
Factoids can be served in any channel, if the 'factoids' directive is set in the channel's configuration.
For factoids to persist, an admin must first touch 'factoids_#(channel).txt' in ASFBot's root directory,
and chown it to the user ASFBot runs as (typically asfbot).

============
IRC Meetings
============
To set up a channel for meeting recording, add the following to the channel's configuration:
 allowLogging: true

If the email feature is to be used, each person chairing a meeting should be set up with karma 
level 3 in the main [karma] configuration, fx:

  johndoe apache/committer/johndoe 3

============
IRC Commands
============
IRC Commands can be used by IRC users with karma (see asfbot.cfg for the default list of users)

alert [message]                     : Sends a message to all IRC channels ASFBot is in
help                                : Lists the available commands

join [channel name]                 : Joins a channel
leave                               : Leaves the channel from which the command was issued

subscribe [pattern]                 : Subscribes the current channel to directories matching [pattern] (using Lua Patterns)
unsubscribe [pattern]               : Unsubscribes the current channel from directories matching [pattern] (using Lua Patterns)
subs                                : Lists the currently subscribed directories for the current channel

karma [add|remove|list] [user]      : Adds/removes/list karma (add people to config.lua for permanent karma)

option [value] [key]                : Sets an option specific to the channel. Use `help option` for more information

reconnect [server]                  : drops an svnpubsub connection and reconnects (use server name only, not port or URL, fx. "svn-master.apache.org")

comment [jira ticket id] [message]  : Replies to a comment through JIRA
restart                             : Restarts the IRC service. This is mainly used for reloading the core features
status                              : Displays the current svnpubsub connection status
tell [recipient] [message]          : Notifies [recipient] of a message when he/she joins the channel or starts to talk.
